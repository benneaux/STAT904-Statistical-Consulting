abstract = {An earlier version of this paper was presented at the 2003 Joint Statistical Meetings and the George Mason Summer Institute for the Preservation of the History of Economics in Economics. We have benefitted from the comments of William Seltzer and Margo Anderson and, especially, this journal's referee. The paper began with a conversation between Levy and Paul David at the Economics of Science Conference at Notre Dame in April 1997 and was greatly stimulated by Perci Diaconis's as yet unpublished 1998 IMS Lecture. Preliminary versions were presented at the George Washington University Economics Seminar, the 1999 Canadian Law and Economics Association meetings, the George Mason Statistics Department Seminar, and the University of Alberta Econometrics Seminar. We have benefitted from comments from James Buchanan, Adolf Buse, Roger Congleton, Tyler Cowen, Mark Crain, Don Gantz, Jim Gentle, Bruce Kobayashi, David Meiselman, John Miller, David Ribar, Robert Tollison, and other participants. The command files to replicate the Monte Carlo study are available upon request. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

@article{Skinner2012,
abstract = {Statistical agencies are keen to devise ways to provide research access to data while protecting confidentiality. Although methods of statistical disclosure risk assessment are now well established in the statistical science literature, the integration of these methods by agencies into a general scientific basis for their practice still proves difficult. This paper seeks to review and clarify the role of statistical science in the conceptual foundations of disclosure risk assessment in an agency's decision making. Disclosure risk is broken down into disclosure potential, a measure of the ability to achieve true disclosure, and disclosure harm. It is argued that statistical science is most suited to assessing the former. A framework for this assessment is presented. The paper argues that the intruder's decision making and behaviour may be separated from this framework, provided appropriate account is taken of the nature of potential intruder attacks in the definition of disclosure potential},
